Hello, this is my very first log entry for the find maze project 2. 

I am very excited to do this project and I am going to try to finish a bulk of the work within the next two hours before I go to sleep!

I have imported all the helper files and created the base file project2.pl

I have also installed swipl to run terminal commands with the open source SWI prolog CLI

Now I have implemeted cell_at/4 to look up a cell in maze by 0 based row and column indices using nth0/3

I tested it on the sample_maze/1, to make sure that 1,1 gives s, and 1,2 gives e  and so on
